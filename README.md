# Squirts

Base game was created by Klemen Slavič and Marko Novak and hosted on git at https://github.com/KrofDrakula/squirts.  The game will be modified to be used as a motivational incentive for an mHealth app for a research study. 

## Build

Install the NPM packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Build using Grunt:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/grunt
```

If you'd like to continuously update the game while hacking on the code, run the `watch` Grunt task:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/grunt watch
```
